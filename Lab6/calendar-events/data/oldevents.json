Thousands of Native Americans, particularly from the Cherokee Nation, were forced to march over a thousand miles to designated Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). The journey was brutal, with inadequate supplies, harsh weather conditions, and disease. Estimates suggest that around 4,000 of the 16,000 relocated Cherokees perished on the Trail of Tears due to starvation, exposure, and illness.",
